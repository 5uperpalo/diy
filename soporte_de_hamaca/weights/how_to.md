Making a garden statue from cement is a fun DIY project that can add a personal touch to your outdoor space. Here’s a step-by-step guide using materials and tools that you can easily find at stores like Leroy Merlin or Bauhaus.

### Materials and Tools You’ll Need:
1. **Cement Mix**: Choose a good-quality cement mix, such as **Portland cement** or **ready-mix concrete** (e.g., Quick-Mix). Available at Leroy Merlin or Bauhaus.
2. **Sand and Gravel (Optional)**: If using pure Portland cement, you’ll need sand and gravel to make concrete. For finer details, you might use just cement and sand (mortar mix).
3. **Water**: For mixing the cement.
4. **Mold**: You can buy ready-made molds (e.g., silicone molds) or make your own using materials like plastic, rubber, or plaster.
5. **Release Agent**: To help remove the statue from the mold, use a mold release agent, such as **WD-40** or cooking spray.
6. **Mixing Bucket**: For mixing the cement.
7. **Stirring Tool**: Use a trowel, shovel, or a mixing paddle attached to a drill.
8. **Protective Gear**: Gloves, dust mask, and safety goggles.
9. **Wire Mesh or Rebar (Optional)**: For reinforcement if making a large statue.
10. **Decorative Finishing (Optional)**: Paints, sealers, or varnishes for final touches.

### Step-by-Step Instructions:

#### Step 1: Prepare the Mold
- **Choose a Mold**: You can buy a pre-made silicone mold for garden statues at Leroy Merlin or Bauhaus, or create your own. To make your own, you can use plaster or clay to sculpt a shape, then create a mold using silicone or latex.
- **Apply Release Agent**: Coat the inside of the mold with a release agent to prevent the cement from sticking.

#### Step 2: Mix the Cement
- **Mixing Ratio**: If you are using a ready-mix concrete, follow the instructions on the package. For Portland cement, use a ratio of **1 part cement to 2 parts sand and 3 parts gravel** for stronger concrete, or **1 part cement to 3 parts sand** for a smoother mortar mix.
- **Add Water Gradually**: Slowly add water and mix until the cement reaches a thick, paste-like consistency. It should not be too runny, as it will be hard to work with and may not hold the shape well.

#### Step 3: Pour the Cement into the Mold
- **Fill the Mold**: Pour the mixed cement into the mold gradually. Tap the sides of the mold gently to release any air bubbles.
- **Add Reinforcement** (Optional): For larger statues, place a wire mesh or small pieces of rebar in the middle of the cement to add strength.
- **Smooth the Surface**: Use a trowel to level the surface.

#### Step 4: Let the Cement Cure
- **Curing Time**: Let the cement sit for at least **24-48 hours** to cure, depending on the size and thickness of the statue. Keep it covered with a plastic sheet and lightly mist with water if the weather is hot and dry to avoid cracking.
- **Remove the Mold**: Once cured, carefully remove the mold. If the mold is silicone or flexible, it should peel away easily. If using a rigid mold, gently tap to release the statue.

#### Step 5: Finishing Touches
- **Smooth or Shape the Statue**: Use sandpaper, a file, or a concrete grinder to smooth any rough edges or refine details.
- **Decorate**: You can paint the statue with **acrylic paints** or concrete stains. Leroy Merlin and Bauhaus offer waterproof paints and sealers that are suitable for outdoor use.
- **Seal the Statue**: Apply a concrete sealer to protect the statue from weathering. This will help it last longer in outdoor conditions.

### Tips for Success:
- **Use Fine Details in the Mold**: If you want a highly detailed statue, choose a mold with fine textures.
- **Experiment with Additives**: You can add color pigments to the cement mix for a unique look, which are available at both Leroy Merlin and Bauhaus.
- **Reinforcement is Key for Large Statues**: If making a large or tall statue, reinforcement with metal rods or mesh can prevent cracking.

### Alternative Materials:
- **Fiber Cement**: This material includes fibers to add strength and can be a good choice for more complex shapes.
- **Plaster for Smaller Projects**: If the statue will not be exposed to the elements, plaster can be used instead of cement.

Using these steps, you can create a variety of garden statues from simple shapes to intricate designs, making your outdoor space unique and personalized.
