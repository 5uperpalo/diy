To estimate the weight of a 20-liter mixture of cement, water, and sand, we need to consider the densities of each component and their proportions in the mixture.

### Step 1: Approximate Densities
- **Cement**: Around **1,440 kg/m³**
- **Sand**: Around **1,600 kg/m³**
- **Water**: **1,000 kg/m³**

### Step 2: Determine the Mix Ratio
Let’s use a common mix ratio for making mortar: **1 part cement, 2 parts sand, and 1 part water** by volume.

### Step 3: Calculate the Volume of Each Component
For a total of **20 liters** with a 1:2:1 mix ratio (cement:sand:water), the individual volumes will be:
- **Cement**: \( \frac{1}{4} \times 20 \text{ L} = 5 \text{ L} \)
- **Sand**: \( \frac{2}{4} \times 20 \text{ L} = 10 \text{ L} \)
- **Water**: \( \frac{1}{4} \times 20 \text{ L} = 5 \text{ L} \)

### Step 4: Calculate the Weight of Each Component
1. **Cement Weight**: \( 5 \text{ L} \times 1.44 \text{ kg/L} = 7.2 \text{ kg} \)
2. **Sand Weight**: \( 10 \text{ L} \times 1.6 \text{ kg/L} = 16 \text{ kg} \)
3. **Water Weight**: \( 5 \text{ L} \times 1 \text{ kg/L} = 5 \text{ kg} \)

### Step 5: Add the Weights Together
Total weight = \( 7.2 \text{ kg} + 16 \text{ kg} + 5 \text{ kg} = 28.2 \text{ kg} \)

Therefore, a **20-liter mixture of cement, sand, and water** (in a 1:2:1 ratio) would weigh approximately **28.2 kg**.
